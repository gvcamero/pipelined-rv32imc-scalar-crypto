# About the project
This project is a modification of an existing base RV32IMC core created by students from UP Diliman Microlab as part of a capstone project. The modifications implemented in this project adds select scalar cryptography extensions to the core:
+ Zbkb - Bitmanip instructions for Cryptography
  + ror
  + rol
  + rori
  + andn
  + orn
  + xnor
  + pack
  + packh
  + brev8
  + rev8
  + zip
  + unzip
+ Zbkc - Carry-less multiply instructions
  + clmul
  + clmulh
+ Zknd - NIST Suite: AES Decryption
  + aes32dsi
  + aes32dsmi
+ Zkne - NIST Suite: AES Encryption
  + aes32esi
  + aes32esmi
+ Zknh - NIST Suite: Hash Function Instructions
  + sha256sig0
  + sha256sig1
  + sha256sum0
  + sha256sum1

The rest of this readme is from the original RV32IMC project's repository.

***

This is an experimental branch that moves the data and instruction memory outside the core, to be replaced with AMBA AXI4/AXI4-Lite bus interfaces. The new core is *core-extmem* and this modified core does not yet work with the top module.

The changes made to the instmem and datamem modules break *top.v* and *core.v*. Do not use this branch if you're trying to use them.

# Pipelined RV32IMC Core
This is a RISC-V RV32IMC core that is currently being adapted for implementation in a test chip as part of [Center for Integrated Devices Research (CIDR) Project 3](https://cidr.up-microlab.org/index.php/Energy_Efficient_Machine_Learning_Hardware_Co-design).

The top module has been tested on the following FPGAs:
+ Artix A7-35T on the [Digilent Arty-A7 board](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/arty-a7/start) (discontinued)
+ Artix A7-200T on the [Nexys Video Board](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/nexys-video/start). 
Constraints files for both FPGAs are provided as part of the code. Other Artix A7-series FPGAs should work once their respective constraints files are set up.

If you would like to use this core as a reference for your own projects, feel free to cite the paper for the original project.

## Creating Vivado Project
+ Clone this GitHub repository to your PC
+ Add **board-files/arty-a7-35** to your Vivado Installation Directory. README.txt contains specific directory.
+ Create a project in Vivado. In Boards, select **Arty A7-35** (part: *xc7a35ticsg324-1L*).
+ Run **project_run.tcl** to add all source files to the project (see section below).
+ Check for any missing sources. You can double check w/ [img/design-hier.png](img/design-hier.png)
+ To generate dump files for assembly-tests, use **dumpgen_script.py**

### Using project_run.tcl
+ Edit `SRCDIR` in **project_run.tcl** to location of this repository in your PC
+ Execute using **Tools > Run Tcl Script...** in Vivado
+ ...or by invoking `source <path to>/project_run.tcl` in the Vivado TCL Console.

### Using assembler.py
```python
> python assembler\assembler.py <input_file.s> <output_file.dmp> -comp_buffer True
```

### Using dumpgen_script.py
+ Set terminal to directory of assembly code before running **dumpgen_script.py**
+ Edit `assembler_folder_path` in **dumpgen_script.py** using absolute path
+ [**RARS**](https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars) is used to generate datamem dumps & answer keys
```python
> python dumpgen_script.py <input_file.s>
```

### Using Vivado ILA
+ Comment/uncomment `ila_ctr` in **top.v**
+ Comment/uncomment Vivado ILA section in the constraints file
